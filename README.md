nzy3d-api
=========

This is a main Git repository for Nzy3d, a .Net API for 3d charts. 

Much of this work is based on Jzy3d, a Java API from [github.com/martin-pernollet](github.com/martin-pernollet).

## nzy3d-api
This is the toolkit by itself. It is based on OpenTK for OpenGL integration in C#.

## nzy3d-tests
This is where all unit/integration tests reside (work in progress).

## nzy3d-wpfDemo
This is a demo of the use of the toolkit in a WPF application.

## About this fork
This fork updates to .net SDK-style projects so everything builds and runs with the 'dotnet' tool.
Dependencies have been updated to current versions. Everything is tested on a clean install of
win10 x64 build 1909.
